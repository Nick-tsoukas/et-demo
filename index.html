            <p class="text-xl mb-6">One of the first full-time independent CE-5 research efforts
                JCETI (Japan Center for Extraterrestrial Intelligence)</p>
            <p class="text-xl mb-6">JCETI was founded in 2010 by Gregory Sullivan, an American who lives full time in Japan. After five years
                of learning the language and the culture, Greg moved back to his home in the New York City area, for
                what he thought was for good.
            </p>
            <p class="text-xl mb-6">
                After just a year and a half of being back in the US, Greg’s soul contract kicked into high gear, and he
                was guided to return to Japan in 2010 with 1 laser pointer, the CSETI Working Group Manual, and two
                walkie talkies. Now in 2019, JCETI has hosted over 450 contact events across Japan, with participants
                totaling over 5000 people.

                    Starting with CE-5 gatherings in Western Japan, word quickly spread and collaborations with several
                    established spiritual groups and communities were to follow. In 2013, JCETI translated the Japanese
                    subtitles for the film SIRIUS, and released an official Japanese DVD in 2014. Following that was the
                    release of documentaries ‘Contact Has Begun’ and ‘Unacknowledged’ in 2019. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-xl mb-6 ">
                    Through a nationwide tour of
                    screening events of these groundbreaking titles, the Japanese public finally became more aware of
                    Disclosure, and the implications for benevolent ET contact. Tours to the ECETI Ranch in Washington, USA
                    have also become a staple part of JCETI’s yearly schedule. And it was at ECETI that Greg had his first
                    major contact experience in 2007.

                <p class="text-xl mb-6">
                    JCETI remains one of the first and largest organized CE-5 contact efforts outside of CSETI network doing
                    large scale overnight workshops one regular basis.
